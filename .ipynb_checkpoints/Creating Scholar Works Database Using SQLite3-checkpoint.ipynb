We ﬁnd that H not only facilitates dislocation\\nemission from the crack tip but also enhances dislocation mobility dramatically, leading to macroscopi-\\ncally softening and thinning of the material ahead of the crack tip. We observe strong binding between\\nH and dislocation cores, with the binding energy depending on dislocation character. This dependence\\ncan directly affect the mechanical properties of Al by inhibiting dislocation cross-slip and developing\\nslip planarity.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.095501\\n\\nPACS numbers: 62.20.Fe, 62.20.Mk\\n\\nThe mechanical properties of solids are not only a func-\\ntion of their intrinsic atomic structure, but also of the en-\\nvironment in which they exist. Small amounts of impurity\\natoms in the environment can drastically change the\\nresponse of a solid to external loading. Hydrogen em-\\nbrittlement is one of the most important and well-studied\\nprocesses of environmental degradation of materials. After\\nover a century of studies, the deﬁnitive mechanism of H\\nembrittlement still remains unknown although signiﬁcant\\nprogress has been made toward developing a detailed\\nunderstanding of the problem. Three general mechanisms\\nfor H embrittement have been proposed:\\n(1) formation\\nof a hydride phase; (2) H-enhanced local plasticity; and\\n(3) H-induced grain boundary weakening [1]. The under-\\nlying atomic processes and the relative importance of the\\nthree mechanisms, however, remain uncertain and contro-\\nversial. In this paper, we study a key aspect of H embrittle-\\nment, referred to as H-enhanced local plasticity (HELP)\\n[2], which has attracted much attention recently. There\\nseems to be overwhelming evidence that plasticity is a\\nfundamental contributor to H embrittlement of virtually all\\nsusceptible metals and alloys, including Al, the model ma-\\nterial we consider in this paper [1,3,4]. The most dramatic\\nexperimental observation is that H increases dislocation\\nmobility signiﬁcantly under constant stress.\\nThis H-\\nenhanced mobility is observed for screw, edge, and\\nmixed dislocations as well as for isolated dislocations and\\ndislocation tangles [1,5]. Other important experimental\\nresults include the observations of slip planarity [4,6] and\\nstrong binding between H and dislocation cores [1].\\n\\nIn contrast to the vast body of experimental evidence,\\ntheoretical studies of the HELP mechanism are scarce. To\\nour knowledge, the only theoretical investigation of the\\nHELP mechanism is based on ﬁnite-element modeling of\\nelastic interactions among dislocations in the presence of\\nH [7]. Although this approach was able to explain the\\nH-enhanced dislocation mobility through the H-induced\\n“elastic shield” effect, it completely ignores the effects of\\nH on dislocation core structure and contains no information\\nfor the relevant atomic processes, which are critical for a\\n\\ncomplete understanding of the phenomenon. The purpose\\nof our work is to provide a comprehensive understand-\\ning of the aforementioned experimental results based on\\nan ab initio theoretical framework, which hopefully can\\nset the stage for an atomistic theory of H embrittlement.\\n\\nIn this paper, we have used the recently developed\\nsemidiscrete variational Peierls-Nabarro (SVPN) model\\n[8–10] with ab initio determined g surfaces [11] and\\nelastic constants. This approach has been shown to predict\\nreliable dislocation core properties by comparing its pre-\\ndictions to direct atomistic simulations based on the same\\nforce law as that used for the g-surface calculations [8,9].\\nThe uniqueness of the approach when combined with\\nab initio calculations for the energetics is that it produces\\nessentially an atomistic simulation for dislocation core\\nproperties without suffering from the uncertainties asso-\\nciated with empirical potentials. For example, atomistic\\nsimulations based on embedded atom method (EAM) po-\\ntentials predict that dislocations in Al will dissociate into\\npartials [12,13], while experimentally no such dissociation\\nis observed [14], a discrepancy which can be traced to\\nthe fact the EAM potentials underestimate the intrinsic\\nstacking fault energy [9].\\n\\nIn the SVPN approach, the equilibrium structure of a\\ndislocation is obtained by minimizing the dislocation en-\\nergy functional\\n\\nUdisl 苷 Uelastic 1 Umisfit 1 Ustress 1 Kb2 lnL ,\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwith respect\\nto the dislocation displacement density\\n[8–10]. The g surface determined from ab initio calcu-\\nlations enters the equation through the Umisfit term. We\\nidentify the dislocation conﬁguration-dependent part of\\nthe elastic energy and the misﬁt energy as the core en-\\nergy, Ucore 苷 Uelastic 1 Umisfit, while the conﬁguration-\\nindependent part of the elastic energy Kb2 lnL is excluded\\nbecause it is irrelevant in the variational procedure and it\\nhas no contribution to the dislocation core structure. The\\nresponse of a dislocation to an applied stress is achieved\\nby the minimization of the energy functional at the given\\n\\n095501-1\\n\\n0031-9007兾01兾87(9)兾095501(4)$15.00\\n\\n© 2001 The American Physical Society\\n\\n095501-1\\n\\n\\x0cVOLUME 87, NUMBER 9\\n\\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S\\n\\n27 AUGUST 2001\\n\\nvalue of the applied stress. An instability is reached when\\nan optimal solution for the density distribution no longer\\nexists, which is manifested numerically by the failure of\\nthe minimization procedure to convergence. The Peierls\\nstress is then deﬁned as the critical value of the applied\\nstress giving rise to this instability.\\n\\nIn order to study the interaction between H and disloca-\\ntions, we have carried out ab initio calculations of the g\\nsurface with H placed at interstitial sites of the Al lattice.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we have used a large supercell containing six\\nAl layers in the [111] direction with four atoms per layer\\nto simulate a low concentration of H impurity (⬃4 at. %).\\nTwo sets of calculations were performed with H placed at\\nthe octahedral and the tetrahedral sites in Al. The ab initio\\ncalculations are based on the pseudopotential [15] plane-\\nwave method with the generalized gradient approxima-\\ntion to the exchange-correlation functional [16]. A kinetic\\nenergy cutoff of 12 Ry for the plane-wave basis is used\\nand a k-point grid consisting of (8, 8, 4) divisions along\\nthe reciprocal lattice vectors is sampled for the Brillouin\\nzone integration.\\nIn our calculations, the H atom is al-\\nlowed to relax freely according to the Hellmann-Feynman\\nforce acting on it while Al atoms are restrained to move\\nonly along the [111] direction. Volume relaxation is per-\\nformed for each sliding distance to minimize the tensile\\nstress on the supercell. Table I lists the various stacking\\nfault energies obtained for the pure Al and the Al 1 H\\nsystems. Although the octahedral site is more stable for H\\nwithout sliding, the energy for the tetrahedral site can be\\nlower for certain sliding vectors. Therefore the energies in\\nTable I and Fig. 1 are given with respect to the lowest val-\\nues of the two sites for each sliding. From Table I we ﬁnd\\nthat H decreases the energy of the various stacking faults\\nby up to 50%, which could change dislocation properties\\nsigniﬁcantly. For example, one can predict that disloca-\\ntions would be emitted more easily from a crack tip when\\nH is present based on the lowering of the unstable stack-\\ning fault energy along the [121] direction [17].\\nIn fact,\\nthis prediction is in accordance with atomistic simulations\\nfor Ni, where dislocations are found to be emitted more\\nrapidly from a crack tip in the presence of H [18].\\n\\nThe g surface for both the pure Al and the Al 1 H sys-\\ntems is shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The\\nenergy along various high symmetry directions is deter-\\nmined from ab initio calculations while the rest of the g\\nsurface is obtained by ﬁtting a symmetrized polynomial\\nbasis, which guarantees the correct rotational symmetry\\n\\nTABLE I. Fault vectors and energies (J兾m2兲 for four important\\nstacking faults of the pure Al and the Al 1 H systems.\\n\\nof the g surface on the (111) plane. Comparing the two g\\nsurfaces, we ﬁnd an overall reduction in energy in the pres-\\nence of H. In order to understand how H affects the elastic\\nproperties of Al, we also calculate the various elastic con-\\nstants for both the pure Al and the Al 1 H systems using\\nab initio approaches. We used a smaller unit cell with only\\nfour Al atoms and one H impurity to facilitate these cal-\\nculations, and ﬁnd that, even at such a high concentration\\nof H, the prelogarithmic elastic energy factors entering the\\nmodel [9] change only by a few percent at most [19].\\n\\nHaving determined all the necessary parameters that\\nenter the model, we can start to investigate the core proper-\\nties for various dislocations in Al. We have studied screw\\n(0±), 30±, 60±, and edge (90±) dislocations. The Peierls\\nstress for these dislocations is shown in Table II. We ﬁnd\\nthat the Peierls stress, which is the minimum stress to\\nmove a stationary dislocation, is reduced by more than an\\norder of magnitude in the presence of H. Moreover this H-\\nenhanced mobility is observed for screw, edge, and mixed\\n\\n0.5\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0\\n\\n0.5\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0\\n\\n(a)\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n(b)\\n\\nIntrinsic stacking\\nUnstable stacking\\nUnstable stacking\\nRun-on stacking\\n\\n095501-2\\n\\nVector\\n1兾6关121 兴\\n1兾10关121 兴\\n1兾4关101兴\\n1兾3关121 兴\\n\\nAl\\n\\n0.164\\n0.224\\n0.250\\n0.400\\n\\nAl 1 H\\n\\n0.103\\n0.126\\n0.132\\n0.310\\n\\nFIG. 1.

Not only is our calculation the ﬁrst successful\\nattempt to explain HELP associated with individual dislo-\\ncation behavior, it also invalidates the perception that the\\nonly plausible explanation of HELP must be based on elas-\\ntic interactions among dislocations and that dislocation-\\nlattice interaction is not important [1]. On the contrary, we\\nﬁnd the dislocation-lattice interaction to be very important\\nand that\\nthe dislocation core structure is responsible\\nfor the observed H-enhanced dislocation mobility. Our\\nresult, however, does not exclude the possibility that\\ndislocation-dislocation interactions do play a role in\\nHELP [7].\\n\\nOther important experimental results that any theory of\\nH embrittlement must explain are the observed H trapping\\nin dislocation cores and the H-induced slip planarity. To\\nthis end, we have calculated the energetics of dislocations\\nfor the pure Al and the Al 1 H systems. The results are\\nshown in Table II. We remind the reader that Ecore listed\\nhere is only the displacement density dependent part of\\nthe total energy, excluding the large positive elastic term\\nKb2 lnL which renders the total energy positive [9]. The\\nbinding energy of H is deﬁned as the difference between\\ndislocation core energies with and without the presence of\\nH. From these results we ﬁnd that there is strong binding\\nbetween H and dislocation cores and that H is attracted\\n(trapped) to dislocation cores to lower the core energies.\\nMore importantly, we ﬁnd that the binding energy is a\\nfunction of dislocation character, with edge dislocations\\nhaving the greatest and screw dislocations having the low-\\nest binding energy, respectively. For a mixed dislocation,\\nwe ﬁnd that the binding energy increases with the amount\\nof edge component. These results have signiﬁcant con-\\nsequences for the experimentally observed inhibition of\\ncross-slip and slip planarity in the presence of H. Experi-\\nments show that in the presence of H slip is conﬁned to the\\nprimary slip plane and dislocation cross-slip is restricted,\\nwhich leads to the observed slip planarity. On the other\\nhand, removal of H from the sample allows a dislocation\\nsegment on the primary plane to reorient towards the screw\\norientation and to complete the cross-slip process [20]. It\\nwas believed from the experimental evidence that any pro-\\ncess, such as cross-slip, that increases the screw component\\n\\nlength at the expense of the edge component will be made\\nmore difﬁcult by the presence of H [20]. Our results for\\nthe binding energy of H in dislocation cores are the key for\\nunderstanding these experimental observations: Since the\\nedge dislocation has twice the binding energy as the screw,\\nit will cost much more energy for an edge dislocation in the\\npresence of H to transform to a screw dislocation in order\\nto cross-slip. In the same vein, it costs more energy for a\\nmixed dislocation to transfer its edge component to a screw\\ndislocation for cross-slip. In other words, H can stabilize\\nthe edge component of a mixed dislocation and inhibit the\\ndislocation cross-slip process, leading to the observed slip\\nplanarity. It is also interesting to point out that our results\\nfor the binding energy of H are in qualitative agreement\\nwith those from atomistic simulations of H in Ni, where\\nthe binding energies of H to edge dislocations and screw\\ndislocations are found to be 0.12 and 0.09 eV per H atom,\\nrespectively [21].\\n\\nTo further understand these results, we calculate the\\ndisplacement density for the various dislocations which\\nis presented in Fig. 2. We ﬁnd that although the intrin-\\nsic stacking fault energy is reduced by almost 40% in the\\npresence of H, dislocations are not dissociated into par-\\ntials [22]. This result is important because it discredits the\\nargument that the observed restriction of cross-slip may\\nresult from the increased separation of partials due to the\\nreduction of the stacking fault energy [23].\\nIn fact, our\\nresult is consistent with the experimental ﬁndings that no\\nwidely spaced dislocation partials were ever observed in\\ntransmission electron microscopic studies of Al contain-\\ning large concentrations of H [20]. Therefore, we believe\\nthat the observed slip planarity and restriction of cross-slip\\nis due to the strong binding between H and the edge com-\\nponent of dislocations, not only for Al, but possibly also\\nfor other metals [4,20,24].\\n\\n30\\n\\n0\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n60\\n\\n90\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n−10\\n\\n−5\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n−10\\n\\n−5\\nDistance (b)\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\nFIG. 2.

(a) H is attracted to crack tips: Application of ex-\\nternal stress produces local concentration of tensile stress\\nin the vicinity of cracks, which attracts H since H prefers\\nto stay in slightly enlarged interstitial sites. (b) Thinning\\nand softening:\\nThese segregated H impurities at the\\ncrack tip can facilitate dislocation generation and enhance\\ndislocation mobility, which will lead to extensive plastic\\ndeformation in front of the crack, causing thinning and\\nsoftening of the material ahead of the crack. (c) Lowering\\nfracture stress:\\nThe thinning and softening processes,\\nalong with the localization of slip due to the inhibition\\nof cross-slip, allow the crack to propagate at lower stress\\nlevels, prior to general yielding away from the crack tip.\\nAlthough our calculations concern Al, we believe that the\\nresults are also applicable to other metals. Furthermore\\nwe should point out that the above processes are not likely\\nto be the only mechanism operating in H embrittlement\\n[5], but are the most relevant processes in line with the\\nHELP theory.\\n\\nIn summary, we have studied the interaction of intersti-\\ntial H with dislocations in Al using the SVPN model with\\nab initio determined parameters. We ﬁnd that H can lower\\nthe Peierls stress of dislocations by more than an order of\\nmagnitude, strongly supporting the HELP model. We also\\nﬁnd there is a strong binding of H to dislocation cores and\\nthat the binding energy is a function of dislocation char-\\nacter. Our ﬁndings explain the experimentally observed\\nrestriction of the cross-slip process and slip planarity in\\nthe presence of H. The dislocations do not dissociate into\\npartials even though the intrinsic stacking fault energy is\\nreduced by 40% in the presence of H. Finally, based on\\nthe results of our calculations, we identify the processes\\nwhich could lead to H embrittlement.\\n\\nThe work at California State University Northridge was\\nsupported by Grant No. DAAG55-97-1-0093 from the\\nU.S. Army Research Ofﬁce.
